2& John Adams& 1797-1801& Federalist& Adams and Thomas Jefferson were close friends and correspondents — but they also had a bit of a rivalry. Adams' dying words were, "Thomas Jefferson survives," unaware that he had died hours earlier. In another shocker, both died on July 4, 1826.& https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Official_Presidential_portrait_of_John_Adams_%28by_John_Trumbull%2C_circa_1792%29.jpg
3& Thomas Jefferson& 1801-1809& Democratic-Republican& Jefferson and John Adams paid a visit to William Shakespeare's home in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1786.

7& Andrew Jackson& 1829-1837& Democrat& Jackson was involved in as many as 100 duels, most of which were fought to defend the honor of his wife, Rachel. He was shot in the chest in a duel in 1806 and took a bullet in the arm in a bar fight with Missouri Sen. Thomas Hart Benton in 1813.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Andrew_Jackson_Daguerrotype-crop.jpg
8& Martin Van Buren& 1837-1841& Democrat& Van Buren's nickname was "Old Kinderhook" because he was raised in Kinderhook, N.Y. A popular theory states that the term "O.K." is derived from the O.K. clubs that sprung up to support his campaign.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Martin_Van_Buren_by_Mathew_Brady_c1855-58.jpg
9& William Henry Harrison& 1841-1841& Whig& Democrats ran a smear campaign during Harrison's campaign that tried to cast him as an out-of-touch old fogey who would rather "sit in his log cabin, drinking hard cider" than run the country. Harrison one-upped the haters by adopting the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols. He even commissioned bottles of hard cider shaped like log cabins.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/William_Henry_Harrison_daguerreotype_edit.jpg
10& John Tyler& 1841-1845& Whig& John Tyler had 15 children, more than any other president. Two of his grandsons are still alive today. One of Tyler's children, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, born in 1853, fathered Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr. in 1924 and Harrison Ruffin Tyler in 1928.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Tyler_Daguerreotype_%28restoration%29.jpg
11& James Knox Polk& 1845-1849& Democrat& Here's one for the underdogs. James Polk, nicknamed "Young Hickory," was America's first dark horse presidential candidate. He was considered a Plan B after the more likely choice, Martin Van Buren, failed to secure the party's nomination.& 	http://www.civilwarshades.org/wp-content/uploads/shades_polk_0002.jpg
12& Zachary Taylor& 1849-1850& Whig& Zachary Taylor was a tough guy — a major general in the U.S. Army and hero of the Mexican-American War. But oddly enough, what brought him down in the end was a glass of milk and some cherries that he enjoyed on July 4, 1850. The cherries were likely contaminated with bacteria that caused his death by cholera five days later.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Zachary_Taylor_restored_and_cropped.png
13& Millard Fillmore& 1850-1853& Whig& Millard Fillmore lived the dream of many a teenage schoolboy.

14& Franklin Pierce& 1853-1857& Democrat& Pierce had a tough time guiding the nation and perhaps an even tougher time guiding his horse. During his presidency, Pierce was arrested for running over a woman with his horse. Charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Mathew_Brady_-_Franklin_Pierce_-_alternate_crop.jpg
15& James Buchanan& 1857-1861& Democrat& James Buchanan regularly bought slaves in Washington, D.C. and quietly freed them in Pennsylvania.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/James_Buchanan.jpg
16& Abraham Lincoln& 1861-1865& Republican& Get ready to rumble: Abraham Lincoln could throw down in the wrestling ring. As a young man, he was only defeated once out of approximately 300 matches. He made it to the Wrestling Hall of Fame with the honor of "Outstanding American."& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Abraham_Lincoln_November_1863.jpg
17& Andrew Johnson& 1865-1869& Democrat& In his youth, Johnson apprenticed as a tailor. Even as president, he never stopped making his own suits.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Andrew_Johnson_photo_portrait_head_and_shoulders%2C_c1870-1880-Edit1.jpg
18& Ulysses Simpson Grant& 1869-1877& Republican& Ulysses S. Grant smoked a ton of cigars — at least 20 a day. After a great military victory at the Battle of Shiloh, citizens sent him more than 10,000 boxes of cigars as gratitude. He died of throat cancer in 1885.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Ulysses_S._Grant_1870-1880.jpg
19& Rutherford Birchard Hayes& 1877-1881& Republican& Hayes was the only president to be wounded in the Civil War — not once, but four times. Four horses were shot down from beneath him (ouch).& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/President_Rutherford_Hayes_1870_-_1880_Restored.jpg
20& James Abram Garfield& 1881-1881& Republican& Not only was Garfield ambidextrous — he could write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other at the same time.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/James_Abram_Garfield%2C_photo_portrait_seated.jpg
21& Chester Alan Arthur& 1881-1885& Republican& Chester A. Arthur was known for his impeccable attire, earning him the nickname "Elegant Arthur." On his last day in office, four women offered him their hands in marriage. Also, he owned 80 pairs of pants.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Chester_Alan_Arthur.jpg
22& Grover Cleveland& 1885-1889& Democrat& While serving as sheriff of Erie County, N.Y., Grover Cleveland had to spring the trap at a hanging on two occasions. This earned him the unflattering nickname "Buffalo Hangman."& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Grover_Cleveland_-_NARA_-_518139.jpg
23& Benjamin Harrison& 1889-1893& Republican& Benjamin Harrison was the first president to have electricity in the White House. However, he was so scared of getting electrocuted that he would never touch the light switches himself.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Benjamin_Harrison%2C_head_and_shoulders_bw_photo%2C_1896.jpg

25& William McKinley& 1897-1901& Republican& William McKinley almost always wore a red carnation on his lapel as a good luck charm. While greeting a line of people in 1901, he gave the flower to a little girl. Seconds later, he was shot by an assassin, and died eight days later.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/William_McKinley_by_Courtney_Art_Studio%2C_1896.jpg
26& Theodore Roosevelt& 1901-1909& Republican& Teddy Roosevelt was shot in an assassination attempt while delivering a speech in Milwaukee. "I don’t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot," he told the stunned audience. "I give you my word, I do not care a rap about being shot; not a rap." He completed the 90-minute speech with the bullet still lodged in his chest.& 	http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2013/12/teddy_portrait.jpg
27& William Howard Taft& 1909-1913& Republican& William Taft — also known as "Big Bill" — was the largest president in American history. He once got himself wedged into the White House bathtub and had to call his advisers for help getting out.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/William_Howard_Taft.jpg
28& Woodrow Wilson& 1913-1921& Democrat& Woodrow Wilson's face is on the $100,000 bill, which very few have ever laid hands on. The bills were mainly designed for trade between between Federal Reserve banks, but fell out of use with the invention of the wire transfer. They still work as legal tender, but good luck finding someone who can break the change for you.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/President_Woodrow_Wilson_portrait_December_2_1912.jpg
29& Warren Gamaliel Harding& 1921-1923& Republican& At 25, Warren married a divorcée, Florence "Flossie" Mabel Kling DeWolf. She was five years older with a 10-year-old son from a former marriage. Flossie's father once threatened to kill Harding if he married his daughter, but she pursued him relentlessly until he gave in. Girl power!& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Warren_G_Harding-Harris_%26_Ewing.jpg
30& Calvin Coolidge& 1923-1929& Republican& If you thought you had a tough boss, think again. Calvin Coolidge would occasionally press all the buttons in the Oval Office, sending bells ringing throughout the White House — and then hide to watch his staff run in. He just wanted to see who was working.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Calvin_Coolidge_cph.3g10777.jpg
31& Herbert Clark Hoover& 1929-1933& Republican& Herbert Hoover's son had two pet alligators, which were occasionally permitted to run loose throughout the White House.& 	https://periodicpresidents.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/31-hh-portrait.jpeg
32& Franklin Delano Roosevelt& 1933-1945& Democrat& Rooselvelt's wife, Eleanor, was actually his fifth cousin. She was also the niece of Theodore Roosevelt, FDR's idol and U.S. president No. 26.

33& Harry S Truman& 1945-1953& Democrat& The "S" in Truman's full name doesn't stand for anything. His parents couldn't decide on a middle name for over a month, so they settled on the letter "S" in honor of his maternal grandfather, Solomon Young, and his paternal grandfather, Anderson Shipp Truman.& 	http://cdn-2.historyguy.com/politics/President%20Harry%20Truman.jpg
34& Dwight David Eisenhower& 1953-1961& Republican& Eisenhower played a big role in popularizing golf. He installed a putting green at the White House and played more than 800 rounds while in office — exceeding the record of any other president. He holds a spot in the World Golf Hall of Fame in the Lifetime Achievement Category.& 	http://a3.files.biography.com/image/upload/c_fit,cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,h_1200,q_80,w_1200/MTE5NTU2MzE2MjExMjE3OTMx.jpg
35& John Fitzgerald Kennedy& 1961-1963& Democrat& JFK was a huge James Bond fan. He first met the author of the series, Ian Fleming, at a dinner party in 1960. They allegedly bounced around ideas about how to get rid of Fidel Castro.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/John_F._Kennedy%2C_White_House_color_photo_portrait.jpg
36& Lyndon Baines Johnson& 1963-1969& Democrat& LBJ wasn't scared to show off his, err, Johnson — he nicknamed his penis "Jumbo." According to biographer Robert Dallek, Johnson met with a reporter who asked him multiple times why American troops were in Vietnam. In response, Johnson unzipped his pants, pulled out "Jumbo," and yelled, "This is why!"& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Lyndon_B._Johnson_Oval_Office_Portrait.tif/lossy-page1-220px-Lyndon_B._Johnson_Oval_Office_Portrait.tif.jpg

40& Ronald Wilson Reagan& 1981-1989& Republican& In 1940, the University of California bestowed Reagan with the Most Nearly Perfect Male Figure Award.

41& George Herbert-Walker Bush& 1989-1993& Republican& On Sept. 2, 1944, Bush was flying over Japan when his aircraft was shot down in the Pacific. Bush and another crewman were able to bail out, but the other man's parachute malfunctioned, and he went down with the plane. Bush was eventually rescued by a submarine off the coast of Chichi-jima.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/George_H._W._Bush,_President_of_the_United_States,_1989_official_portrait.jpg/220px-George_H._W._Bush,_President_of_the_United_States,_1989_official_portrait.jpg
42& William Jefferson Clinton& 1993-2001& Democrat& It wasn't just Clinton's southern charm that did it for the ladies. His face is so symmetrical — an important component of human attractiveness — that he ranked in facial symmetry alongside male models.& 	https://mowryjournal.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/clinton-bill-presidential-portrait.jpeg
43& George Walker Bush& 2001-2009& Republican& "Dubya" garnered the media attention with his frat boy past, but he also has a more wholesome side (aside from painting, that is). During his senior year of high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., Bush was captain of the cheerleading team.& 	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/George-W-Bush.jpeg
44& Barack Hussein Obama& 2009-2016& Democrat& Obama's high school nickname on the basketball team was "Barry O'Bomber," which he earned due to his awesome jump shot.& 	https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/Administration/People/president_official_portrait_hires.jpg
45& Donald John Trump& 2016-Present& Republican& The Donald has never smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol or done drugs.
